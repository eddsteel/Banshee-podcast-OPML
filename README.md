Banshee Podcast OPML
====================

This script exports banshee podcast information to an OPML file, which can be
imported into feed readers, podcatchers, etc. To do so, simply make the script
executable, add your name and email address to it (if you want), and run it. 

The banshee database is expected to be at `~/.config/banshee-1/banshee.db`. If
it isn't, you'll need to modify the script.

The OPML is output to std out, which can be directed to a file.

Required gems
-------------
You will need the SQLite3 gem (`gem install sqlite3`).

It's not exactly complex, but fwiw this script is public domain if you want to
build on it.
